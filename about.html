        <h2 class="initialblock">Introduction </h2>
            <p class="block"> This is my first semester at Amherst College as a transfer student. I am currently a junior and am aiming for a degree in Computer Science. 
                Before moving to Amherst, I attended De Anza College in California where I completed my Associates' degree in Computer Science. 
            </p>

        <h2>A <i> Brief </i> Life Recap</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li> I was born in Karachi, Pakistan and am the youngest in my family. </li>
            <li> I spent about 15 years living in the U.A.E and I grew up learning 3 different languages. </li>
            <li> At school, I learned English and Arabic and at home I learned Urdu with my parents. </li>
            <li> After graduating highschool at 17, I was lucky enough to pursue my undergraduate studies abroad which is how I ended up in the U.S! </li>
            <li> I attended De Anza in California because I have family there and community college is <em>pretty</em> affordable. </li>
            <li> I was initially a bionegineering major, but developed a <strong> deep </strong> interest in computer science after taking my first programming course in C++. </li>
            <li> Along with being a student, I was also a math tutor for 2 years at my college's tutoring center. </li>
            <li> Being a tutor allowed me to meet a lot of cool people and makes me want to become a teacher <i>one</i> day!  </li>
        </ul>
        <p> I believe that my experiences growing up of being an immigrant and an international student in the U.S have allowed me to learn a lot more about myself and the world at a faster pace and I am very grateful for it all.</p>
